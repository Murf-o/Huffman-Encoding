# Huffman-Encoding
Lossless Compression via the Huffman Encoding algorithm.

 Creates ".hi" files for a dataset which creates a file that you can use to decode whichever file you want.
 This ".hi" file is used to compress and decompress your datasets -- in other words, if you mix and match your dataset and .hi files, you will most likely get a different dataset than what it originally was.
 Displays Compression ratio, space saving (%), and the number of characters in the original file vs the compressed file.

 Compressed files have an added ".hc" extension added to the original file name.
